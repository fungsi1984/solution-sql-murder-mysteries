Yes, we can improve the solution by making it **more concise** and **efficient** while still using only `SELECT` statements. The key is to minimize redundancy and avoid unnecessary subqueries by combining steps where possible. Here's the improved version:

---

### Improved Solution

#### Step 1: Find the Witnesses and Their Statements
We can combine the queries to find the witnesses and their statements in one go.

```sql
-- Find witnesses and their statements
SELECT p.name, i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE (p.address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
       AND p.address_number = (
           SELECT MAX(address_number)
           FROM person
           WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
       ))
OR (p.name LIKE 'Annabel%'
    AND p.address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave');
```

---

#### Step 2: Find the Suspect
From the witness statements, we know:
- The suspect has a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag with a membership number starting with "48Z".
- The suspect is a gold member.
- The suspect's car plate includes "H42W".

We can directly find the suspect using these clues.

```sql
-- Find the suspect
SELECT p.name, gf.id AS membership_id, dl.plate_number
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN get_fit_now_member gf ON p.id = gf.person_id
WHERE gf.id LIKE '48Z%'
AND gf.membership_status = 'gold'
AND dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';
```

---

#### Step 3: Confirm the Suspect's Alibi
Check the suspect's gym check-in on the day of the murder.

```sql
-- Confirm suspect's alibi
SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id IN (
    SELECT gf.id
    FROM person p
    JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
    JOIN get_fit_now_member gf ON p.id = gf.person_id
    WHERE gf.id LIKE '48Z%'
    AND gf.membership_status = 'gold'
    AND dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
)
AND check_in_date = 20180109;
```

---

#### Step 4: Find the Mastermind
From the suspect's interview, we know:
- The mastermind is a woman with red hair, around 5'5" to 5'7", drives a Tesla Model S, and attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

We can directly find the mastermind using these clues.

```sql
-- Find the mastermind
SELECT p.name, dl.height, dl.hair_color, dl.car_make, dl.car_model
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE dl.gender = 'female'
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'
AND fb.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND strftime('%Y-%m', fb.date) = '2017-12'
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

---

#### Step 5: Verify the Mastermind's Income
Check the income of the mastermind to confirm she has a lot of money.

```sql
-- Verify mastermind's income
SELECT i.ssn, i.annual_income
FROM income i
JOIN person p ON i.ssn = p.ssn
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE dl.gender = 'female'
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'
AND fb.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND strftime('%Y-%m', fb.date) = '2017-12'
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

### Final Answer
The murderer is **Jeremy Bowers**, and the mastermind who hired him is **Miranda Priestly**.

---

### Why This is Improved:
1. **Fewer Queries**: Combines steps where possible to reduce redundancy.
2. **Efficient**: Avoids unnecessary subqueries by directly filtering data in the `WHERE` clause.
3. **Readable**: Each query is concise and focuses on a specific task.
4. **SQLite-Compatible**: Uses SQLite-specific functions like `strftime` and `LIKE`.

### Full Improved Query
Hereâ€™s the entire solution in one place:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find witnesses and their statements
SELECT p.name, i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE (p.address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
       AND p.address_number = (
           SELECT MAX(address_number)
           FROM person
           WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
       ))
OR (p.name LIKE 'Annabel%'
    AND p.address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave');

-- Step 2: Find the suspect
SELECT p.name, gf.id AS membership_id, dl.plate_number
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN get_fit_now_member gf ON p.id = gf.person_id
WHERE gf.id LIKE '48Z%'
AND gf.membership_status = 'gold'
AND dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

-- Step 3: Confirm suspect's alibi
SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id IN (
    SELECT gf.id
    FROM person p
    JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
    JOIN get_fit_now_member gf ON p.id = gf.person_id
    WHERE gf.id LIKE '48Z%'
    AND gf.membership_status = 'gold'
    AND dl.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
)
AND check_in_date = 20180109;

-- Step 4: Find the mastermind
SELECT p.name, dl.height, dl.hair_color, dl.car_make, dl.car_model
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE dl.gender = 'female'
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'
AND fb.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND strftime('%Y-%m', fb.date) = '2017-12'
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;

-- Step 5: Verify mastermind's income
SELECT i.ssn, i.annual_income
FROM income i
JOIN person p ON i.ssn = p.ssn
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE dl.gender = 'female'
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'
AND fb.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND strftime('%Y-%m', fb.date) = '2017-12'
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```
